Have you ever gazed upon the soaring heights of the majestic eagle, or listened to the haunting croak of the raven, and wondered what it would be like to live as these creatures?

I have. Every day, I imagine myself soaring through the skies, free as a bird. I feel the wind in my feathers and the sun on my face as I glide over the landscape. I see the world from a new perspective, and I feel a sense of awe and wonder.

But I also know that the life of a bird is not easy. There is the constant threat of predators, the harsh elements of nature, and the never-ending search for food. But the ravens, they are survivors. They are intelligent and adaptable, and they can thrive in almost any environment.

That is why I am drawn to the raven. I admire their strength, their resilience, and their wild spirit. If I could choose any animal to be, it would be the raven.

I would soar through the skies, a dark silhouette against the clouds. I would perch on high cliffs, surveying my domain. I would feast on the dead, and I would sing my haunting song to the world.

I would be a raven, and I would be free.
