Just picked up a brand new [Yamaha MT-07 Pure 2023](https://www.yamahamotorsports.com/models/23_mt-07/specs)! It's a nearly 700cc naked bike, a huge jump from my old 125cc [Honda Grom](https://powersports.honda.com/motorcycle/minimoto/grom?year=2023).

Last year, I decided to get a motorcycle for fun. Copenhagen has great public transportation, so a car wasn't necessary. I wanted to enjoy the commute and explore outside the city, but coming from a car background with limited motorcycle experience, I opted for a smaller, beginner-friendly bike.

The Grom was perfect for learning and tinkering. It's known for being easy to maintain, and there are tons of YouTube tutorials for repairs and modifications. I even did some work myself, learning from those videos!  While it was a fun and valuable experience, the Grom's biggest drawback is its speed. Highway rides were a struggle, and as I started dreaming of European tours in the spring and summer, I knew it wouldn't be ideal.

With touring in mind, I researched bikes with at least a 300cc engine, but nothing crazy fast – I wasn't looking for a monster machine. I narrowed it down to a few options:

- [Triumph Scrambler 400 X](https://www.triumphmotorcycles.com/motorcycles/classic/scrambler-400-x/scrambler-400-x-2024)
- [Husqvarna Svartpilen 401](https://www.husqvarna-motorcycles.com/en-us/models/naked/svartpilen/svartpilen-401-2024.html)
- [Ducati Icon Scrambler](https://www.ducati.com/us/en/bikes/scrambler)
- [Honda SCL500](https://powersports.honda.com/motorcycle/standard/scl500)
- [Yamaha MT-03](https://www.yamahamotorsports.com/models/mt-03)

Test rides on the Triumph and Husqvarna left me wanting more power. I knew 400cc wouldn't be enough. Luckily, a colleague with motorcycle expertise chimed in. He suggested the Yamaha MT-07, a bigger and more powerful version of the MT-03.

I took his advice and test rode the MT-07. Wow! It was a revelation. Cruising on the highway, feeling the true thrill of a motorcycle – it was amazing. The price fit my budget perfectly, making it the clear winner.

I bought it on the spot! I'm taking a short vacation to Budapest this week, but as soon as I'm back in Copenhagen, I'll be picking up my new adventure machine. European tours, here I come!

I'm keeping the Grom though. It's still a fantastic little city bike, perfect for navigating traffic.
