  <h2 class="">Hello</h2>

  <p> My name is Sepehr ﴾سپهر﴿, but I go by "<strong>Sepi</strong>". I'm a full-stack software engineer living in <strong>Copenhagen, Denmark</strong>. I've been programming since I was a teenager, and I started my career professionally in 2010. </p>

  <p> My first computer was a <strong>PC</strong> with a Pentium 1 processor and <strong>Windows 98</strong>. The first programming language I learned was <strong>Pascal</strong>, but I soon moved on to <strong>C/C++</strong>. In 2006, I started using <strong>Gnu/Linux</strong>, and that's when I got more serious about programming and discovered the free and open-source community. These days, I use a combination of <strong>macOS</strong> and <strong>Ubuntu</strong>, and I mainly program in <strong>Go</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. </p>

  <p> I hope you enjoy my personal website! </p>
